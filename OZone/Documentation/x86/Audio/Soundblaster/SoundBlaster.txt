PCM Format

Channel
	Low Byte
	[High Byte] (16-bit)

Transfer Rate (Time Constant)
	Hi(0xFF - ((256,000,000) / (channels * sample rate)))

Direct Mode
	8-bit Mono Unsigned PCM Only
	Timer Interrupt Based
	
Single-Cycle DMA Mode
	64K DMA Block Limit
	Can not cross over 64K boundary
	Calls interrupt after block transfer complete
	
Auto-Initialize DMA Mode
	64K DMA Block Limit
	Can not cross over 64K boundary
	Calls interrupt after block transfer, and continues with next block
	
High-Speed DMA Mode (No Longer Supported in DSP 4.00+)
	Improves speed by ignoring commands during data transfer
	Supports Single-Cycle and Auto-Initialize DMA Modes
	Requires reset to stop transfer in Auto-Initialize mode
	Reset exits High-Speed DMA mode and restores state
	8-bit and 16-bit PCM data only

Play 16-bit Stereo Audio (DSP 4.00+)
	Allocate DMA Buffer (8K)
	Program DMA Controller (16-bit, Auto-Initialize)
	Send Set DSP Sample Rate Command (41h, ACh, 44h)
	Send Play Audio Command With Sample Count - 1 (B6h, 30h, C9h, 07h)
	While Audio Data Available
		Wait For Interrupt
		Fill DMA Buffer With Audio Data

	Send Exit Auto-Initialize DMA Mode Command (D9h)
	Release DMA Buffer
