The Proper Way to issue a command:
 
1.Read MSR (port 0x3F4). 
2.Verify that RQM = 1 and DIO = 0 ((Value & 0xc0) == 0x80) -- if not, reset the controller and start all over. 
3.Send your chosen command byte to the FIFO port (port 0x3F5). 
4.In a loop: loop on reading MSR until RQM = 1. Verify DIO = 0, then send the next parameter byte for the command to the FIFO port. 
5.Either Execution or Result Phase begins when all parameter bytes have been sent, depending on whether you are in PIO mode, and the command has an Execution phase. If using DMA, or the command does not perform read/write/head movement operations, skip to the Result Phase. 
6.(In PIO Mode Execution phase) read MSR, verify NDMA = 1 ((Value & 0x20) == 0x20) -- if it's not set, the command has no Execution phase, so skip to Result phase. 
7.begin a loop: 
8.Either poll MSR until RQM = 1, or wait for an IRQ6, using some waiting method. 
9.In an inner loop: transfer a byte in or out of the FIFO port via a system buffer, then read MSR. Repeat while RQM = 1 and NDMA = 1 ((Value & 0xa0) == 0xa0). 
10.if NDMA = 1, loop back to the beginning of the outer loop, unless your data buffer ran out (detect underflow/overflow). 
11.Result Phase begins. If the command does not have a Result phase, it silently exits to waiting for the next command. 
12.If using DMA on a read/write command, wait for a terminal IRQ6. 
	1.Loop on reading MSR until RQM = 1, verify that DIO = 1. 
	2.In a loop: read the next result byte from the FIFO, loop on reading MSR until RQM = 1, verify CMD BSY = 1 and DIO = 1 ((Value & 0x50) == 0x50). 
13.After reading all the expected result bytes: check them for error conditions, verify that RQM = 1, CMD BSY = 0, and DIO = 0. If not retry the entire command again, several times, starting from step 2! 


To access drives: 

1.Turn on the drive's motor and select the drive, using an "outb" command to the DOR IO port. 
2.Wait for awhile for the motor to get up to speed, using some waiting scheme. 
3.Issue your command byte plus some parameter bytes (the "command phase") to the FIFO IO port. 
4.Exchange data with the drive / "seek" the drive heads (the "execution phase"), on the FIFO IO port. 
5.Get an IRQ6 at the end of the execution phase, but only if the command HAS an execution phase. 
6.Read any "result bytes" produced by the command (the "result phase"), on the FIFO IO port. 
7.The commands "Recalibrate", "Seek", and "Seek Relative" do not have a result phase, and require an additional "Sense Interrupt" command to be sent.
